# cloud-starter

Hi there! Welcome to Hack@Brown's Cloud starter kit. We will go over some of the most basic and useful AWS tools, including S3, EC2, and Lambda.
To find more information about AWS, you can check out [this](https://aws.amazon.com/) page, which links many resources for exploring AWS products and applications.

Never heard of these services? Never heard of AWS? No problem!

## Instructions

You can find tutorials for S3, EC2, and Lambda in [this](https://github.com/hackatbrown/cloud-starter/blob/main/Cloud%20Starter%20Kit.pdf) document! This document also explains how to set up an AWS account. At the time of the creation (and updating) of this starter kit, all three of these services (S3, EC2, and Lambda) have a free tier in AWS.

However, note that you must give payment information to AWS to create your account, although you will not be charged if you stay within this free tier. To find more information about how to stay within the free tier, check out [this](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=fce796e8-4ceb-48e0-9767-89f7873fac3d&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwhL6pBhDjARIsAGx8D5-XNwMDCC2vCXxcxJ-_AFJTKnxKGUmttKPANpmGSqo_oHjoNbqqCDwaAkYtEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!432339156150!e!!g!!aws!1644045032!68366401852&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=tier%23trial&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) page. We also explain the free tier in the tutorial document.
